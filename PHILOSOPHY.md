# 🌍 PROJECT PHILOSOPHY - PhotoQuest

## Core Idea

**AI transforms any city into a personalized interactive photo quest in 60 seconds.**

This is not just a game.
This is:

- City exploration
- Active engagement
- Personalization
- Memory creation

---

## 🧠 Deep Philosophy (Simply Explained)

### 1️⃣ City as Game World

The world already contains content (OSM, landmarks).
Your AI doesn't create the world — it interprets it as a game.

### 2️⃣ Tourist = Active Participant, Not Consumer

**Traditional tours** → Listen and watch
**Questo** → Walk and read story
**Your app** → Act and prove you were there

**Photo = Proof of participation**

### 3. Vintage Travel Poster Aesthetic

Every screen should feel like a collectible postcard or a 1930s-1950s travel poster. This includes:

- **Color Palette**: Muted, sun-baked tones (cream, ochre, sage green, deep navy).
- **Typography**: Bold, stylized serif headers coupled with clean, readable sans-serif body text.
- **Imagery**: Stylized, slightly grain-textured illustrations or photos with "edge-fading" effects.
- **Layout**: Clear borders, strong central subjects, and "stamp-like" UI elements.

### 4️⃣ AI = Director, Not Knowledge Base

AI:

- Selects locations
- Creates atmosphere
- Verifies completion

But the world is real.
This is important for architectural purity.

### 5️⃣ Memory > Reward

You're right:
**Reward doesn't have to be physical.**

Philosophy:
**Quest is a way to create a personal travel story.**

**MVP Rewards:**

- Achievement screen
- Photo gallery
- Message: "You are an explorer of [City]"

Simple, but emotional.

## 💡 Portfolio Description

Use this formulation:

### AI Photo Quest Generator

**AI-powered web application that dynamically generates personalized city photo quests using open geographic data (OpenStreetMap) and validates user submissions via computer vision (Gemini).**

The system:

- Retrieves real-world POIs
- Builds logical walking routes
- Generates contextual photo challenges
- Verifies uploaded images with AI
- Creates an interactive travel experience in any city worldwide

## 🔥 The Right Philosophy for You

You are transitioning from:
**Backend developer**

To:
**AI Product Engineer**

Your MVP should demonstrate:

- AI control
- Architectural thinking
- Working with open data
- Cost awareness
- SaaS approach

## 🧠 Super Important Moment

**Don't make a "magical AI application".**

**Make:**
**A controlled system with a clear pipeline.**

This will impress Travus Cloud.

## 📚 Inspiration: Questo Features

### Two Ways to Play:

#### 1. Outdoor Quest Games (for locals)

Perfect for a spontaneous day in your city. These quests work like outdoor escape rooms — you solve tasks to uncover the story.

**For couples:** Try "Murder Mystery: Crime on a Date"
**For families:** Play "Kids Quest" (ages 4-8)
**For friends:** Treasure hunt challenges

#### 2. Story-Driven Walking Tours (for travelers)

Not just sightseeing — immerse yourself in history. Partner with local writers to create game-based walking tours.

**New York:** Walk revolution streets in "Hamilton"
**London:** Find truth in "Jack the Ripper"
**Paris:** Discover romance in "Lost Lovers of Montmartre"

**Worldwide Access:** Available in Rome, Berlin, Barcelona, and 1000+ cities

### Multiplayer & Competition

**Cooperative mode:** One phone, solve puzzles together
**Versus mode:** Split into teams, compete on leaderboard

### Questo Pass

Unlimited adventures with new pass system.
**Unlimited play:** As many quests as you want (3 days, 7 days, year)
**No auto-renewal:** No subscriptions or hidden fees
**Start when you want:** Countdown begins with first quest, not purchase

### Why Players Choose Questo

- **Affordable:** Much cheaper than escape rooms or guided tours
- **Flexible:** Start when you want, pause for coffee/lunch
- **Privacy:** No crowds, just you, friends, and phone
